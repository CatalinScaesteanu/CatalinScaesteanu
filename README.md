I’m a TypeScript focused engineer who loves turning ideas into
smooth, fast, and accessible web experiences with modern web
technologies like Next.js and React. My journey began in university,
building websites for community events, and grew into crafting
everything from custom sites to e-commerce platforms and APIs. Right
now, I’m diving into applied AI, exploring how smart technologies
can take the web to the next level.
